## Description of the Page


The website construction is in the `src` directory.  A `language` directory with two JSON files holding the text to choose English or Hungarian. The layout of the three pages is in the `pages` directory, and their styles are in `pages.css`. Most other parts of the page are in the `components` directory. Here are the `header` and the `footer` directory. The `header` has the `menu` and a button for choosing the language. The `components` directory also owns the animations between pages, the `layout.jsx`, and the `main.jsx`.  The `clickleftarrow.jsx`, the `clickrightarrow.jsx`,  the `scrolltop.jsx`, and the `siteanimation.js` build the animations. I set the routes in the `main.jsx`. The `layout.jsx` includes the `header` and the `footer`.
